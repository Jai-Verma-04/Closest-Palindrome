# Closest-Palindrome
Python program to print closest palindrome to a number.
* What is a Palindrome? A word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards.

- The user enters a number and the program finds the closest number which is a palindrome.
- The number found can be both smaller or larger than the input number.... meaning the program finds all numbers below and above (sort of) of that number for a palindrome.
